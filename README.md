Digital Clock using Python
This Python script implements a simple digital clock that displays the current time in a 24-hour format. The clock updates every second and runs continuously until terminated by the user.

Features
Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
Updates in real-time, refreshing every second.
Minimalist design for clarity and ease of understanding.
Implemented using Python's time module for time manipulation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional libraries required.
Usage
Clone the repository or download the expect.py file.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python expect.py
The clock will start running and display the current time. It will continue to update until you terminate the script manually.
Example
Here's a brief example of how the clock looks when running:
