# Digital Clock using Python
## Overview
This Python script implements a digital clock that displays the current time in a 24-hour format. It continuously updates to reflect the current time accurately. This project is a simple demonstration of using Python's time module to manipulate and display time data.

## Features
Real-time Updates: The clock updates every second to display the current time accurately.
24-Hour Format: Time is displayed in the 24-hour format (HH:MM
).
## Simple and Minimalist Design: The script is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand.
Cross-platform: Works on any platform where Python is installed (Windows, macOS, Linux).
## Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Raghul2103/digitalclock.git
Alternatively, download the digital_clock.py file directly.

Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd digital-clock-python
Run the script:

bash
python digital_clock.py
## Usage
Upon running the script, the digital clock will start displaying the current time.
The clock will update every second, showing the current hours, minutes, and seconds.
## Example Output

Current Time: 13:45:22
Current Time: 13:45:23
Current Time: 13:45:24
